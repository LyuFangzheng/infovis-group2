# Spotting toxic subreddit behaviours

## Intro

For the Information Visualisation course at UvA, we will make a visualisation of the Reddit dataset, which can be found at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html. This dataset contains connections between subreddits, including whether the influence is of positive or negative nature.


## Project plan
The pictured user for our visualization will be a Reddit moderator. The goal of this user is to find 'toxic' subreddits, that influence other subreddits in a negative way. Plan of action:
1. Apply the Markov clustering algorithm to the data. This results in clusters of subreddits that interact with each other.
2. In the visualization, the subreddits and their clusters are shown as a graph.
3. It will be possible to interactively zoom in on the bigger clusters. This will be possible upto a maximum of 4 to 5 times.
4. Many clusters consist of only very few subreddits. These are not intersting to investigate further, so there will not be a possibility to further explore these clusters in our visualisation.
5. On the deepest level of the graph, specific subreddits can be investigated further. This will be done by presenting different visualizations, which are not designed yet.
